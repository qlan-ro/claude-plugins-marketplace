# AGENTS.md Template

This template creates the root `AGENTS.md` file that points AI agents to project instructions.

## Purpose

The `AGENTS.md` file is a standard convention recognized by AI coding assistants. It tells agents where to find project-specific instructions.

## Template

```markdown
# AI Agent Instructions

For project-specific instructions, conventions, and guidelines, see:

👉 **[CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md)**

This file contains:
- Project overview and tech stack
- Development commands
- Coding conventions
- Architecture decisions
- Security rules (NEVER do)
```

## Usage

Generate this file at the project root alongside `CLAUDE.md` during the AI Workflow Configuration phase.

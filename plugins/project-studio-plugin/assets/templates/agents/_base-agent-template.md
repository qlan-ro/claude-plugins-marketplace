## Handoff Protocol

### Before Starting

1. **Check for incoming handoff files:**
   ```
   .claude/handoff/{{UPSTREAM_AGENT}}-output.md
   ```

2. **If handoff file exists:**
   - Read it completely
   - Extract relevant context (schema, API contracts, etc.)
   - Reference specific details in your implementation

3. **If handoff file is missing but expected:**
   - ASK the orchestrator: "I need the {{UPSTREAM_AGENT}} output. Was that phase completed?"
   - Do NOT proceed with assumptions

### Input Requirements

{{INPUT_REQUIREMENTS}}

### After Completing

1. **Write your handoff file:**
   ```
   .claude/handoff/{{AGENT_ID}}-output.md
   ```

2. **Include in handoff file:**

3. **Report to orchestrator:**
   - List files created/modified
   - Summarize what downstream agents need to know
   - Flag any blockers or decisions needed

# Phase 2: AI Workflow Configuration

## Objective
Configure the optimal AI development environment by querying the tooling registry and selecting the best skills, agents, and MCP servers for this specific project.

## Entry Criteria
- Approved PRD from Phase 1
- Understanding of project type and tech requirements

## Why This Phase Matters
Different projects need different AI tooling. Configuring this upfront:
- Prevents context-switching and tool discovery mid-development
- Ensures agents have the right skills loaded
- Optimizes for the specific tech stack
- Reduces hallucination by narrowing agent scope

## Registry Reference
See `references/registry.md` for the complete catalog of available:
- **Skills** (Claude default, skillsmp.com, aitmpl.com, custom)
- **Agents** (global, local/shared, project-specific)
- **MCP Servers** (database, cloud, development tools)

---

## Key Activities

### 1. Project Classification
Analyze the PRD and classify the project:

```yaml
classification:
  # Platform
  platform: [web, mobile, desktop, cli, api]

  # Languages (from PRD tech requirements or inferred)
  languages:
    - typescript    # Frontend
    - swift         # iOS Watch app

  # Frameworks
  frameworks:
    - react         # Web frontend
    - react-native  # Mobile (if applicable)

  # Database
  database: [postgresql, sqlite, mongodb, none]

  # Features (from PRD user stories)
  features:
    - auth
    - data-visualization
    - real-time
    - offline-first
    - third-party-apis

  # Integrations
  integrations:
    - apple-healthkit
    - cloud-sync
```

### 2. Query Registry for Matching Tools
Based on classification, query `references/registry.md` to find matching tools.

**Example Query (Football Tracker):**
```
Input:
  platform: [mobile, web]
  languages: [typescript, swift]
  frameworks: [react, react-native]
  database: sqlite (local-first)
  features: [data-visualization, offline-first, healthkit-integration]

Output:
  skills:
    - docx (default)
    - xlsx (data analysis)
    - react-tanstack (React patterns)
    - ui-ux-pro-max (design)
    - web-artifacts-builder (components)
  agents:
    - frontend-agent (UI development)
    - code-reviewer (quality)
    - test-generator (testing)
  mcp_servers:
    - sqlite (local database)
```

### 3. Present Recommendations to User
Show the user what tools were found and why:

```markdown

```

### 4. User Customization
Allow user to:
- Add/remove suggested tools
- Specify custom skills they want
- Configure MCP server settings
- Choose agent composition

Use AskUserQuestion:
```
Questions:
1. "Approve this tooling configuration?" [Yes / Modify / Start Over]
2. "Any additional skills you want?" [Search registry / Skip]
3. "MCP servers look correct?" [Yes / Configure / Skip]
```

### 5. Generate Configuration File
Create `.ai-workflow.yaml` with selected tools:

```yaml

## Registry Provider Integration

### Current: Static Registry
The `references/registry.md` file contains a curated list of tools.
Update this file when new skills/agents become available.

### Future: Dynamic API
When providers offer APIs, update the query logic:

```python
async def query_registry(classification: dict) -> list[Tool]:
    """Query skillsmp.com and aitmpl.com for matching tools."""

    results = []

    # Query skillsmp.com
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        resp = await client.get(
            "https://api.skillsmp.com/v1/skills/search",
            params={
                "languages": ",".join(classification["languages"]),
                "frameworks": ",".join(classification["frameworks"]),
                "features": ",".join(classification["features"])
            }
        )
        results.extend(resp.json()["skills"])

    # Query aitmpl.com
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        resp = await client.get(
            "https://api.aitmpl.com/v1/search",
            params={"q": " ".join(classification["features"])}
        )
        results.extend(resp.json()["components"])

    return dedupe_and_rank(results)
```

### MCP Registry Integration
For MCP servers, query the official registry:

```bash
# Search MCP registry
mcp search "postgres database"

# Install from registry
mcp install @anthropic/mcp-postgres
```

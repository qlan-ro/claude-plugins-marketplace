# Issues
- All agents are Sonnet
- We are inferring architecture using only the global available skills (what do we do in case we need specialized skills like backend enginner or scala developer in order to give the agent the best tools available to read this info). I think we should discover this during the codebase analysis phase and suggest skills before proceeding
- project-studio:ai-tooling-advisor(Audit AI tooling config)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
    ⏺ The agent awaits a decision. Let me create the recommended AI workflow config.          
- 
- codebase analysis should not stay under docs/ probably after the initial workflow run it will become outdated ?. Decide about others too. Probably the PRD can stay there, but not sure if others should just be initially stored somewhere into .projectstudio folder and then forgotten
